{"input": "scene: the living room description: Two people are sitting in chairs in a room facing a television. One of the people is an older \"grandma\" aged woman. The other person has lots of hair growing all around their face/head and on their hands/arms. You can't see the person's face. The woman appears to be gesturing to something happening on the TV. uncanny: It's unusual to see a person covered in so much hair that their entire head is obscured. entities: Television, Boredom. caption: They do say results will vary.", "target": "The woman is surprisingly dismissive of her partner's extreme side effects from taking a hair growth medication. Usually, for such a medicine, \"results may vary\" is a hedge against hair not regrowing stated in commercials (like the one they are watching for the medication) --- but here, the surprising outcome is that the hair grew too much all over the man's body.", "instance_id": "09004902779588429d63ca06842b4326", "caption_choices": "They do say results will vary.", "generated_idefics": " The caption \"They do say results will vary\" is a humorous way of acknowledging that the outcome of a situation or activity may not be consistent or predictable. It is often used to lighten the mood or to poke fun at the unpredictability of life. In this image, the three people sitting in front of the TV are watching a plant grow, and the caption suggests that the plant's growth may not be consistent or predictable."}
{"input": "scene: a psychiatry office description: A psychiastrist is in her office. She's talking to a car that is on her couch. uncanny: There is a car instead of a patient. entities: Car, Therapy. caption: Where do the voices tell you to go?", "target": "A joke about how a self-driving car might be commanded by voices of users of that car. People, particularly with schizophrenia, might go to therapists to help manage voices they hear. But the car isn't schizophrenic --- people are literally giving it verbal commands of what to do, which makes the idea of it getting therapy for the voices funny because we know the car isn't hallucinating.", "instance_id": "2d534d248e1770eaa7bc010534e2728b", "caption_choices": "Where do the voices tell you to go?", "generated_idefics": " The caption is referring to the idea of autonomous vehicles, like self-driving cars, which are becoming more prevalent. The question \"Where do the voices tell you to go?\" is an attempt to understand the inner workings of these vehicles and how they make decisions. The \"voices\" in this context could be the artificial intelligence or the programming that guides the car's actions."}
{"input": "scene: nowhere description: One guy is introducing a dressed up man to the other man. The dressed up man has scuba gear, camping gear, sword, camera etc on him. uncanny: Man fully dressed up with different gear (hiking, fighting, camping, photography etc.) is unusual. entities: Tourism, Katana. caption: In this economy, you have to let the vacation come to you.", "target": "The joke is about a man saving money not by going on vacation doing cool activities like scuba diving, camping, playing baseball, etc., but instead, staying at work, and simply wearing the garments associated with these leisure activities. The joke is funny because the joy of vacation isn't just wearing the clothes, is the escape from work --- however, the speaker points out that he can only afford this type of non-vacation.", "instance_id": "2fe8d051b2f11cde0649afd0146f008b", "caption_choices": "In this economy, you have to let the vacation come to you.", "generated_idefics": " This caption is a humorous twist on the idea of \"going on vacation\" and \"letting the vacation come to you.\" Instead of actively planning and taking a trip, the person is suggesting that the vacation will find its way to them. It's a lighthearted way of saying that sometimes opportunities for relaxation and leisure will present themselves without much effort on the person's part."}
{"input": "scene: a corporate meeting room description: An executive is looking at a profit chart. Some farmers are coming into the room with a donkey. uncanny: The farmers are not dressed for the modern day. entities: Profit_(accounting), Prospecting, Retirement. caption: You the Ponzi varmint that lost our nest egg?", "target": "A reference to Charles Ponzi, the namesake of the \"Ponzi scheme\", which is a failed scam investment. Ponzi is at the desk watching profits go down, and the country folks whose money he was playing with are at the door and want answers for where their money is. A reference to how big city bankers play fast and loose with the investments of people who they will never know or meet.", "instance_id": "72e642f619a13896b42043d77fc73e55", "caption_choices": "You the Ponzi varmint that lost our nest egg?", "generated_idefics": " The caption is referring to a man who is involved in a Ponzi scheme, which is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation. The man in question is being accused of losing the investors' money, and the speaker is expressing their anger and frustration with him."}
{"input": "scene: a business office description: A man is sitting at a table with his hand on a phone. There is a vulture perched in front of him. uncanny: A vulture is an unusual bird to have indoors. entities: Businessperson, Vulture, Speakerphone. caption: Janice, hold all my calls. Indefinitely.", "target": "A vulture often circles over a nearly dead animal in the wild to scavenge its corpse for food. The joke here is that, the vulture has identified the man as someone about to die, and, surprisingly, he also agrees: he nonchalantly tells his secretary to hold his calls/work forever, because he's about to die. He doesn't seem to care that he's about to die, and instead focuses on his benign work obligations, which is funny.", "instance_id": "8d765c41eeff9319df30c4002c2235f3", "caption_choices": "Janice, hold all my calls. Indefinitely.", "generated_idefics": " The caption is a play on the phrase \"hold all my calls,\" which means to take all the phone calls that are intended for someone. In this case, the person who is holding all the calls is Janice. The phrase \"indefinitely\" suggests that Janice will be doing this for an unknown, possibly long period of time. The reason for this action is likely to help the person who said this, Dr. Sbork, focus on their work or to prevent them from being disturbed by phone calls."}
