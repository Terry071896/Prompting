In this scene, the person covered in hair might be trying out a strange beauty treatment, and the grandma is gesturing to the TV as if to say \"results will vary\". The joke is that the person's face is obscured, so you can't see their reaction to the treatment, and the grandma's gesture is cryptic and unclear. It's a play on the phrase \"results may vary\" which is often used to indicate that the outcome of a particular action is uncertain or unpredictable. Here, the phrase is used to indicate that the person's reaction to the hair growth treatment is uncertain or unpredictable because their face is obscured. It's a clever play on words that creates a humorous situation out of an otherwise mundane scene."}
